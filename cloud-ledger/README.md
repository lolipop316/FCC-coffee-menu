# Cloud Ledger  

This is my personal log while I learn cloud and security.  
I’m using this repo to track what I study, practice, and build as I go through certifications and small projects.  

Right now my main focus is **CompTIA Security+** and **AWS Solutions Architect Associate**, but I’ll keep adding more as I learn.  

## What’s inside
- **projects/** – small builds, diagrams, and experiments  
- **logs/** – notes from study sessions and labs  
- **notes/** – key points and quick summaries I want to remember
